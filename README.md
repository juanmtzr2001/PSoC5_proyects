# PSoC5_proyects

This project involved the development of a spirometer programmed on a PSoC 5, a microcontroller by Cypress Semiconductor. Additionally, a graphical interface was created in LabVIEW to plot a graph of the patients' inhalations and exhalations.

Additionally, in this repository, you can find other projects developed during the second semester of 2023 using the same microcontroller. These projects include EEPROM, input capture, pointers, the use of an LCD screen, and a seven-segment display.
